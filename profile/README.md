# What Is GuestSneezeOS?
GuestSneezeOS Is An Operating System For Gamers World Wide Who Is Like Me And Doesn't Have A Steam Deck (You Can Use HoloISO Its Like The Hackintosh Of SteamOS But Later). GuestSneezeOS Offers Many Essential Apps Such As "Steam","Discord","BalenaEtcher" And More, All Distro's Comes In Various Different Shapes And Sizes Unlike Most Gaming Distro's Such As [Nobara](https://nobaraproject.org/), [ChimeraOS](https://chimeraos.org/) ,[HoloISO](https://github.com/holoiso-eol/holoiso) And Bazzite These Distro's Are Great And Amazing I Actually Use These In My Daily Life But You Can See An OS Comparison By Clicking [Here](#comparison). The Best Thing About GuestSneezeOS Is Its Low System Requirements Such As Unlike Bazzite That Requires 50+ GB Our OS Requires Only 11 GB
